Tested up to: 3.5.1
Requires at least: 3.2
Stable tag: 1.1.20

Maybe the second-best Gallery plugin for WordPress

== Description ==

Create a photo gallery from your existing photo directories.

If you are new to Lazyest Gallery, please consider [Eazyest Gallery](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/eazyest-gallery/). Eazyest Gallery is the successor to Lazyest Gallery and is far better integrated with WordPress, and [compatible with popular plugins](http://brimosoft.nl/lazyest/compatible-plugin/).

This gallery basically needs just two settings: Your image directory and your gallery page. Lazyest Gallery automatically creates a photo gallery with folders, sub folders, thumbnail pages and slide shows.

If you want more, the gallery offers a multitude of options by featuring a smart back end management site. You can sort photos through folders and add captions, comments and descriptions with minimal effort. If you are tired of uploading photos through the WordPress server, this plug-in will make it a breeze with their FTP auto-indexing integration.

For more information about version 1.1.20, read the [release notes](http://brimosoft.nl/2013/03/19/lazyest-gallery-1-1-20/)

Read all about the [version 1.1 series](http://brimosoft.nl/tag/1-1/)

I will add no extra features to the plugin, but will update and support the plugin for bug fixes and compatibility issues.
[Eazyest Gallery](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/eazyest-gallery/) will replace Lazyest Gallery soon.
The Eazyest Gallery plugin offers the functionality of Lazyest Gallery, but is far better integrated in WordPress.
